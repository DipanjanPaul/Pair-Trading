# Pair-Trading

This is a basic implementation of the pairs trading algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairs_trade). It reads a series of "15 minute" securities quote data and tries to identify securities that have been historically in strong correlation. It also identifies if any of those historically strongly correlated securities are currently weakening and tracks them for investment opportunities.
